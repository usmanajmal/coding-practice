**README:**

This repository records stuff, I learn over time. This helps me get back to the work, I produced after practicing
via multiple different resources. Recording the work here makes it easier for me to re-learn in future in no or less
time. And because I like the GitHub Graph view of committed changes. :-p 

Feel free to use this material for learning purposes. If you find some mistakes, please pull a request for bug fix 
or just drop me an email. 

Thank you.
